#Design Elements

This application will be featured only on iOS for the time being due to only knowing about Swift and iOS application development. 
Please note that most signs will be the Canadian version, so some signs may differentiate if using in the United States of America. ASL is 
used by both Canada and United States.
#

#Features

Dictionary
  - Will feature a large library with most beginner signs
  - Separated into different categories
  - Categories include but are not limited to: Alphabet, Numbers, Emergency Signs, Animals and Places.
  - When a user selects a word/number/letter the sign will be displayed as an image with a comprehensive description about it.
        ***Please note that some signs may have multiple movements, and it has yet to be decided how this will be implemented ***
  - Letters will have two images for them, being the front and back. I believe that this will help people understand the finger placement better for each letter.
  - May or may not have a search feature. Unsure at this time. *** Will be updated when decision has been made ***

Fingerspelling
  - Will have a section describing the importance of fingerspelling.
  - Will attempt to indicate that for beginners, the structure of finger placement is more signifigant thatn speed.
  - Will have comprehensive tips about fingerspelling.
  - Have a "game" which letters or numbers will appear on the screen for a limited time, and the user will match this. 
  - Speed for the "game" will be determined by the user. The user will select a skill level.
  - Game will allow users to test their ability at remembering the appropriate sign and their ability to think on the fly.
  
Test Game
  - Select correct sign.
  - Can select which category of signs that will be included.
  - Might have achievement system which congragulates the users on different levels of achievement.
  - Still in early stages of developement, and this is all that has been decided thus far.
  

#Ideas

May Include:
  - Videos
  - History of ASL
  - Importance of Deaf Culture

More ideas are being thought of daily, and implementation may change drastically. This is an ongoing project of mine that I think will help people be more
aware of deaf culture in Canada and the United States. Any collaboration or if you have any ideas please email me at bryanlavallee@hotmail.com, and please put the 
subject line to: ASL Application.
